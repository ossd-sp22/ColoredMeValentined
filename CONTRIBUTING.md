# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to ColorMeValentined! As with any open source project, we can't make it as good as possible without help from you and others.

We want to make contribution to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug - no one has perfect code. Help us know where we went wrong.
- Submitting a fix - no one still has perfect code. Help us fix what we did wrong.
- Proposing a new feature - look at our `choose_mood.js` file for core functionality
- Documentation - comment on any structures, functions, or anything else that needs clarification.

Please note that we have [a code of conduct](https://github.com/ossd-sp22/ColoredMeValentined/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with this project.

## General Workflow

### Git Workflow

- When making changes, please follow this format:
  - First, pull the repo to get the most recent changes (instructions can be found in the [README](./README.md))
  - Create a new branch with a brief name that describes the change
  - Make the changes and test vigorously
  - Pull once more (makes merging easier)
  - Push and create a pull request with a descriptive title and detail. Link the appropriate issue.
  - Request reviews from someone else before merging

### Rules of Contributing & Considerations

- Please fork when appropriate
- Look at our issues pages to see what a good contribution would be
- Open an issue if you would like to propose a feature before you begin working on it (there may be a reason why it has not been implemented)
- Make a pull request when changes are deemed adequate.
- Consider the size of your contribution â€“ is it too big for one pull request?

### Coding Standards

- Try to not over-engineer. Write minimum code to get things working end to end, only then iterate to improve.
- Do not push directly to master. Rather, create a branch and pull request for future changes.
- Provide descriptive commit messages.
